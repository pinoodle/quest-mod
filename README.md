# Quest 5.8.0 Dark Mode + Zoom Patch
This is a mod for Quest 5.8.0 (https://textadventures.co.uk/quest) that forces dark mode and/or adds the ability to zoom in/out on all games you play.

## Usage
* ZOOM: Once installed, you can enlarge Quest's interface by pressing CTRL and +, or make it smaller by pressing CTRL and -.
* DARK MODE: This forces a dark theme onto all Quest games you play.

## Installation
* To only apply the ability to zoom: copy-and-paste the contents of the LIGHT MODE folder into your Quest installation folder (should be C:/Program Files (x86)/Quest 5). If it wants to merge any folders - allow it. If it wants to overwrite any files - allow it. Restart Quest, and you're done!
* To apply both the ability to zoom and dark mode: copy-and-paste the contents of the DARK MODE folder into your Quest installation folder (should be C:/Program Files (x86)/Quest 5). If it wants to merge any folders - allow it. If it wants to overwrite any files - allow it. Restart Quest, and you're done!
